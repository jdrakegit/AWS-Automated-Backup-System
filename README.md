# AWS-Automated-Backup-System
An automated AWS backup system I'm building to learn AWS Backup, IAM, and infrastructure as code. Backs up resources on a schedule, alerts me if something fails, and follows least-privilege security practices.


## The Problem

Companies lose data all the time. Someone deletes the wrong file, a server gets corrupted, ransomware hits, or an employee leaves and something important goes missing with them. If backups aren't automatic, they usually don't happen at all, since manual backups depend on someone remembering to do them.

To fix that, backups need to run on their own, without a person clicking anything. That means giving something other than a human the permission to do it, which is where an IAM role comes in. Instead of using my own login, I set up a role that only AWS Backup can use, so it can create backups automatically on a schedule without me needing to be logged in or even awake.
